# ps-scripts
A collection of PowerShell scripts I've written

AdminResetInternetConnection.ps1 script resets DNS, IP lease and winsock.

PingTracertOSID.ps1 script is a automated wip of this process: https://gbhackers.com/operating-systems-can-be-detected-using-ping-command/

TempTestPathMdir.ps1 script tests whether the Temp folder exists on root C drive. If False, creates the folder.

TracertHops.ps1 script runs traceroute on a specfied IP address, then outputd the number of hops taken.
